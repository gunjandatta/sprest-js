## SharePoint JavaScript Library

This library extends the [Office Fabric-UI JS library](https://dev.office.com/fabric-js), to help create Office 365 components in SharePoint 2013/Online (Classic) environments. Reference the [JavaScript library](https://gunjandatta.github.io/extras/js) for information on this library, or [SharePoint REST Framework](https://gunjandatta.github.io) for a full overview of the framework.

### **Important** Bootstrap Library Replacement

There have been user voices related to the Office Fabric-UI JavaScript framework, and newer ones that target [web components](https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329220-sharepoint-dev-platform/suggestions/35100433-office-ui-fabric-as-web-components). At this point, it's safe to say that Microsoft is definitely not going to update the Office Fabric-UI JavaScript framework. I will continue to support any issues reported for this library, but do not plan to add new features.

My recommendation is to convert to use the [gd-sprest-bs](https://gunjandatta.github.io/extras/bs) library, which extends the Bootstrap framework.
